libdasm examples
================

In this directory, there should be files of two example projects.

**simple** - is a very basic example disassembler which
basically just disassembles and prints out one instruction.

**disassembler** - is more complex example which can be used for disassembling a
file with some formatting options.

You can use CMake to compile this examples.

Have fun!
